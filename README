## Locator/ID Separation Protocol Cache Emulator

The LISP Cache emulator is software that is able to emulate the tasks of LISP
xTRs and that is essentially designed to be fed with packet-level Internet
traffic. Therefore, like a real LISP router, the emulator needs two data
stores, namely the LISP Database and the LISP Cache.  The LISP Database is a
manually configured list of internal network prefixes (EIDs), while the LISP
Cache stores EID-to-RLOC mapping when there is a request for it and removes it
according to the preconfigured expiration rule.  The emulator uses a local BGP
prefixes database fed with the list of BGP prefixes published by the iPlane
Project. This BGP prefixes database is used to group EID-to-RLOCs mappings with
the granularity of existing BGP prefixes.
